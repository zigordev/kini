 * One endpoint, reporting everything.
 *
 * `status` is `ok` when every component is up, `degraded` when an optional one
 * is down, and `error` (503) when a required one is. The distinction matters:
 * this service PRODUCES to Kafka rather than consuming from it, so a broker
 * outage stops emails being queued but leaves everything else working. Failing
 * the whole health check for that would take the service out of rotation over a
 * partial degradation.
 *
 * The database is required — without it there is nothing to serve.
 *
 * Note for the future: a single dependency-probing endpoint is fine as a Docker
 * healthcheck, which does not restart on failure. Used as a Kubernetes liveness
 * probe it would turn a database blip into a restart loop; a separate liveness
 * path would be needed then.
